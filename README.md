# Credit Card Fraud Detection System

**End-to-End Machine Learning Application with FastAPI & Web Frontend**

---

##  Overview

The **Credit Card Fraud Detection System** is an end-to-end machine learning project that detects fraudulent credit card transactions in real time.
It combines **data preprocessing, model training, a FastAPI backend, and a web-based frontend** to demonstrate how ML models are deployed in real-world applications.

This project focuses not only on model accuracy, but also on **production-ready ML deployment practices**, including feature consistency, API design, and version control hygiene.

---

## Key Features

* **Real-time fraud prediction** using a trained ML model
* **FastAPI backend** serving predictions via REST API
* **Interactive frontend** for entering transaction details
* **Proper feature engineering & scaling** aligned with training pipeline
* **Robust handling of training-only features** (industry-grade inference logic)
* Clean Git repository (no large datasets or model artifacts committed)

---

## Machine Learning Details

* **Problem Type:** Binary Classification (Fraud / Legitimate)
* **Algorithm Used:** Logistic Regression
* **Preprocessing:**

  * Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`
  * Consistent feature ordering during inference
* **Evaluation Metric:** Probability-based fraud detection

> *Special attention was given to ensuring that inference-time features exactly match training-time features — a common real-world ML deployment pitfall.*

## Dataset Information

Due to GitHub size limitations, **datasets and trained model files are not included** in this repository.

* Datasets used: Credit Card Transactions (Fraud Detection)
* Place datasets inside the `data/` folder before training
* Model artifacts can be regenerated by retraining

## Key Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates:

* End-to-end ML system design
* Feature consistency between training & inference
* Handling real-world deployment bugs
* API-based ML serving
* Clean Git practices for ML projects
* Debugging production ML pipelines

> 💬 *Many ML models fail not because of accuracy, but because of deployment mismatches — this project explicitly addresses that.*

---

## Future Improvements

*  Fraud probability visualization (progress bar)
*  Store predictions in MySQL
*  Authentication (Sign In / Sign Up)
*  Cloud deployment (Render / Railway)
*  Dockerization
